# War 
This code was written with the intent of learn more about Xcode, swift programming, and learning best practices for application development. 

When I saw this project I giggled to myself remembering I used to play it when I was young. I also remembered playing this game with a friend recently. “This game is stupid!” was what we thought. But we still played though it and it was quite entertaining. 

#Gameplay
This is a one player game, player vs computer. When the player clicks the deal button the cards are flipped and whichever player has the higher card will win.
The game will go on forever until you want to stop. 

#What I learned
While writing this code I learned how to use the auto layout feature of Xcode to layout the components of the game board. It was quite interesting how easy it was to make the app compatible for both landscape and portrait mode. 

I also learned to navigate Xcode’s panel. Finding it useful to change element properties, adding elements and assets, finding the code to modify, and building the layout with views. I’m sure there are more tips and tricks to navigate, but I will find those at a later time.

Most importantly I learned a little bit more about Apple’s UIKit. To my surprise it’s huge! I used and learned about a couple of them like the UIButton, UIImage, UIImageView, UIViewController. While doing this I also got to learn more about Swift coding and how the code is written and works. 

#ToDos
-Upgrade the game to a standard deck
-Add animations for wins
-Add ability for 2 players
